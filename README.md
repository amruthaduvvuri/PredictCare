**🚀 Fetal Health Risk Classifier**

Hey there! 👋 This is a project where I built an interactive machine learning system to predict fetal health status (Normal, Suspect, or Pathologic) based on Cardiotocogram (CTG) data — the same kind of measurements doctors use to monitor fetal well-being.

It’s designed to support early detection of fetal distress, helping healthcare providers make faster, data-driven decisions, and ultimately contribute to reducing maternal and infant mortality.

**🩺 What makes it cool?**

✅ 96% accuracy with a Gradient Boosting model — way ahead of simpler approaches.
✅ A full ML pipeline: from data cleaning, EDA, multi-model training, and hyperparameter tuning to feature importance analysis.
✅ Live FastAPI backend serving real-time predictions.
✅ A sleek Streamlit dashboard where clinicians (or you!) can enter CTG parameters and instantly see health risk classifications — color-coded for clarity.

**⚙️ Under the hood**
	•	🐍 Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy for the ML side
	•	⚡ FastAPI + Uvicorn to serve the model as an API
	•	🎨 Streamlit for an intuitive, clinical-style dashboard
	•	🔗 Managed on GitHub, ready for collaboration

**💡 Why this matters:**
It’s more than just code — it’s a step toward making healthcare analytics accessible, helping spot problems early, and giving clinicians an extra edge to make life-saving decisions.
